# Database-Management-Systems-Term-Project
## Summary :  
This was my final project for my Database Systems Management course during my Spring 2019 semester at TAMUCC.
The general idea of this project was a database for a game/movie store. This project includes several tables 
including tables of employees, customers, and the itmes they are selling.
There are also several stored provedures that add and print several variables to whoever wants to view the data.
